# Learning Resources
Here, we put together Python & Jupyter-based tutorials and resources ranging from fundamentals in programming to data science for geoscience examples, that are useful for different levels of developers and researchers with interest in AI for NDM.


* [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) {cite}`projectpythia` - The educational resource project for the geoscience community provides tuturials for Python-centered, open-source, and geoscience-focus toolset.
  + [Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org) {cite}`pythiafoundations` - Foundational computing techs you need to start your geoscience projects starts from getting to know Python to libraries like Cartopy, Pandas, and Xarray.
  + [Cookbooks](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org/) - Examples on some domains in geoscience build on top of the foundations.
* [Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io) {cite}`earthandenvironmental` - The book grew out of a course at Columbia University focuses on data analysis in the earth and environmental sciences. This includes computing environment bascis like Jupyter, Unix, and Git and in-depth exploration of the numerical analysis and visualization packages with scientific Python ecosystem.
* [Environmental Data Science (EDS) book](https://edsbook.org/) {cite}`edsbook` - This book is a living, open and community-driven online resource to showcase and support the publication of data, research and open-source tools for collaborative, reproducible and transparent Environmental Data Science.
* [TC PRIMED Learning Journey](https://github.com/CSU-CIRA/tcprimed_learning_journey) {cite}`tcprimed` - The NOAA/CSU **T**ropical **C**yclone **PR**ecipitation, **I**nfrared, **M**icrowave, and **E**nvironmental **D**ataset (TC PRIMED) aims to ameliorate the issue of disparate data sources by consolidating forecast products from various data sources into a single repository.TC PRIMED is in an analysis- and AI-ready format. This structure fosters new research to better understand tropical cyclones and new forecast product development. The TC PRIMED development team has created a Learning Journey to help you learn how to interact with TC PRIMED files.
