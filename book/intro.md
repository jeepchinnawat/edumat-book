The Working Group on Educational Materials to Support Capacity Building aims to enhance access of the focus group to external audiences, with a focus on least developed countries and small island developing states. Developing, producing, and sharing these educational materials will help promote the value of AI in managing natural disasters, primarily by documenting successful use cases - and identifying potential ways in which AI can help address previously intractable or difficult problems. By including as wide a range of external stakeholders and FG-AI4NDM participants as possible in the development of the educational materials, the working group hopes to foster capacity sharing and education as part of its actual working processes.
