# Learning Resources
Here, we put together resources ranging from fundamentals in programming to data science for geoscience examples; hoping that they are useful for different levels of developers and researchers with interest in AI for NDM.


* [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) {cite:empty}`projectpythia` - The educational resource project for the geoscience community provides tuturials for Python-centered, open-source, and geoscience-focus toolset.
  + [Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) {cite:empty}`pythiafoundations` - Foundational computing techs you need to start your geoscience projects starts from getting to know Python to libraries like Cartopy, Pandas, and Xarray.
  + [Cookbooks](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org/) - Examples on some domains in geoscience build on top of the foundations.
